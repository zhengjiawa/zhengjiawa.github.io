## Welcome to Zhengjia's Homepage!

Presently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ICT](https://www.ict.ac.cn/)), under the supervision of [Juan Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fSBdNg0AAAAJ). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Beijing Jiaotong University.

If you have any inquiries or are interested in potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out via e-mail (E-mail: zhengjiawa@qq.com), in either English or Chinese.

## Research Interests

My research interests are at the intersection of natural language processing and data mining, with a focus on:
- **News Intent Mining:** toward deeper news understanding by analyzing, interpreting, and leveraging the intent behind news creation.
- **Misinformation and Disinformation:** detection and mitigation of misleading, false, or manipulated content.


## News
